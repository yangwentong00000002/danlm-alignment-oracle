# DanLM: Tokenization Is All You Need to Master Complex Card Games

A game AI that learns entirely from raw game history via self-play reinforcement learning, with **truly zero domain knowledge — no policy priors, no hand-crafted features**, what you see is what you get, surpassing hand-crafted SOTA in GuanDan (掼蛋), a complex 4-player trick-taking card game hugely popular across China.

**Disclaimer: This project was developed through ~100% vibe coding (powered by Claude Opus 4.6). While extensively tested, the code and documentation may contain critical bugs, hallucinations, or inaccuracies.** We are actively working on fixing these issues. Use at your own risk and verify critical results independently. If you encounter any problems, feel free to [open an issue](../../issues).

### Updates

(2026-04-03) 🔥 DanLM has reached **#1** on the [Botzone GuanDan leaderboard](https://en.botzone.org.cn/game/ranklist/65490c16ec1ab1389702dced), surpassing all the other 30 bots.

## Key Idea

Existing card game AI systems (DouZero, DanZero, PerfectDou, Suphx, etc.) usually rely on **carefully designed hand-crafted features**, including too much domain knowledge like pre-calculated statistics and secondary information of the game.

**DanLM shows that raw game history speaks for itself.** The input is simply the raw play-by-play game transcript — who played what cards, in order — tokenized like natural language. The model learns what matters from scratch, through self-play RL and causal sequence modeling.

| Aspect | Previous SOTA (DanZero) | DanLM |
|--------|------------------------|------------|
| State features | 567-dim hand-crafted | Raw token sequence |
| Architecture | MLP | TinyLM + MLP |
| Domain knowledge | Yes | No |
| Training | DMC self-play | DMC self-play + NTP |

## Evaluation

### Models

| Model | Main Architecture | State Representation |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| DanZero | MLP | 567-dim hand-crafted |
| DanZero V1T | MLP | 964-dim hand-crafted |
| DanLM V1 | causal Transformer | raw info tokenization (~90 vocab)|

> **DanZero V1T** is our enhanced reproduction of DanZero with bug fixes, stronger state representation, and fully model-driven action selection (original DanZero uses heuristics for tribute). It exceeds the original DanZero's performance under the same training settings, serving as a stronger hand-crafted baseline.

### Metrics

- **Single-Round Win Rate**: One round with a random level, random tribute/back, and random deal. The team whose player finishes first wins. This is a stricter metric with less variance amplification.
- **Whole-Game Win Rate**: A complete game consisting of multiple rounds with level progression from 2 to A. This is the metric used in the original DanZero paper (Table I). Single-round advantages are amplified over multiple rounds (e.g., 54% single-round → ~66% whole-game).

### Baseline Bots

We include **16 competition bots** from the [1st National GuanDan AI Algorithm Competition (首届中国人工智能掼蛋算法大赛)](https://gameai.njupt.edu.cn/gameaicompetition/guandan_machine_code/index.html) as standardized evaluation baselines, consistent with the DanZero paper's evaluation protocol.

**Key finding: competition rankings do NOT reflect actual bot strength.** Many bots have critical bugs in their source code that caused crashes during the competition. For example, njupt-guandan-ai only won a consolation prize due to a None-check bug causing ~49% of games to crash — but it is actually the strongest bot after the fix. **We fixed all bots one by one and evaluated against their bug-free versions.**

See `baselines/` for the full bots collection.
